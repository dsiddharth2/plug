# Architectural Decisions

## Why Ink + React for the TUI

**Chosen over:** blessed, tui-rs (Rust), terminal-kit, pure ANSI escape sequences

Ink renders React components to the terminal. The decision to use Ink came from several converging factors:

- **Same stack as Claude Code's `/plugins`** — Claude Code's own plugin browser is built on Ink. Using the same library means the UX model (tabs, lists, keyboard input via hooks) will feel native to Claude Code users.
- **Existing Node.js project** — plug is already a Node.js ESM package. Adding Ink is one `npm install`; no language boundary, no subprocess, no IPC.
- **Component model fits the problem** — a tab-router that swaps screen components, each owning its own state, is a natural fit for React. Alternative libraries would require managing screen lifecycles manually.
- **Declarative re-render on state change** — Ink re-renders on state update automatically. This is important for live search (every keystroke triggers a re-filter and re-render) and install progress (per-package status updates stream in).

## Why tsx for the JSX transform

**Chosen over:** Babel + `@babel/register`, esbuild, SWC, manual JSX pragma

The project uses Vitest for tests, which already requires a dev-time transform step. tsx (TypeScript Execute) provides JSX transform for both `node` invocation and Vitest without requiring a separate Babel config or build step. It works with Node's native ESM (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`) and doesn't require changing existing `.js` files — only the new TUI files use `.jsx`.

This keeps the toolchain minimal: no Webpack, no Rollup config, no separate compile step before running the CLI.

## Why the stdout capture wrapper (rather than rewriting commands)

The existing commands (`runInstall`, `runRemove`, `runUpdate`, `runVaultSync`, etc.) write their progress and results to `process.stdout`. Ink owns the terminal during rendering — any external write to stdout corrupts the screen layout.

Two alternatives were considered:

1. **Rewrite command functions** to return structured data instead of writing to stdout. This would have required touching every command file and changing their public API, risking regressions in the CLI path.
2. **Subprocess + IPC** — spawn each command as a child process and capture its stdout. Adds process-management complexity and latency.

The stdout capture wrapper (`src/tui/utils/capture-stdout.js`) takes a third path: temporarily monkey-patch `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write` to accumulate output into a string, then restore them in a `finally` block. The existing command functions run unchanged. The TUI receives the captured string and parses the JSON output (commands run with `ctx.set({ json: true })` in TUI mode) to extract structured results.

This approach is:
- Zero-diff on the command files
- Reliable (always restores stdout, even on error)
- Sufficient — commands already support `--json` output for structured data

## Why a shared search-scoring utility

The search ranking algorithm (exact name: 40, partial name: 30, description: 20, tag: 10) was originally embedded inside `src/commands/search.js` as a local function. The TUI's `useSearch` hook needed the same logic for live filtering in the Discover and Installed screens.

Rather than copy the algorithm, it was extracted into `src/utils/search-scoring.js` as a pure, side-effect-free function (`scoreMatch(name, pkg, keyword) → number`). Both `src/commands/search.js` and `src/tui/hooks/use-search.js` import from this shared utility.

This matters because scoring tuning (adding new tiers, adjusting weights) now needs to happen in one place and both CLI search and TUI live-filter stay in sync automatically.

See: `src/utils/search-scoring.js`

## Why `/` to focus search

**The problem:** The TUI needs both live text search and single-key action shortcuts (`i` install, `u` update, `r` remove). A user typing `i` to search for packages starting with "i" would inadvertently trigger the install action.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Require `Ctrl+F` or `F3` to enter search — non-obvious, not muscle-memory for most users
- Disable action keys always — too restrictive, forces extra steps for common operations
- Separate search input at top, always focused — loses keyboard-navigation feel

**Chosen design:** Two explicit modes, toggled by `/` and `Esc`:
- **Navigation mode** (default): arrow keys move cursor, action keys are active when items are toggled
- **Search mode** (entered with `/`): all printable characters append to the search query, action keys are disabled

`/` is the conventional "search" key in many TUI tools (vim, less, man pages). It is not a printable character that would appear in a package name, so it is unambiguous as a mode toggle. `Esc` is the universal "back/cancel" key.

The key invariant: action keys only fire when **both** (a) at least one item is toggled and (b) the search box is not focused. This is checked in each screen's `useInput` handler before dispatching any action.
